// FIX: Removed NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL — redundant alias for NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL.
// Having two variables that do the same thing creates confusion: if only one is
// set in Vercel, the fallback chain silently uses the other, hiding misconfig.
// Standardized to NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL everywhere. Update Vercel env accordingly.
export const API_BASE_URL =
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL ??
  "http://localhost:4000/v1";

// Strip the /v1 path segment to get the bare socket server URL.
// e.g. "http://localhost:4000/v1" → "http://localhost:4000"
export const WS_URL =
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL ??
  API_BASE_URL.replace(/\/v\d+\/?$/, "");

// REMOVED: RESTAURANT_ID — slugs are now dynamic from the URL.
// Use the `slug` parameter from `useParams()` or route props instead.

// TAX_RATE is intentionally not exported as a hardcoded constant.
// Tax rates vary per restaurant and are served via GET /v1/menu/:slug/theme
// (theme.taxRate). Access it with: const { taxRate } = useRestaurant()
// This prevents cart totals from silently using the wrong rate when a
// restaurant has configured a custom tax rate in their settings.
